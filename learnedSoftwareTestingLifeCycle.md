* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
### Testing
* STLC
    * STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle. STLC is a sequence of different activities performed by the testing team to ensure the quality of the software or the product.
    * STLC is an integral part of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). But, STLC deals only with the testing phases.
    * There are 6 major phases of STLC −
        * Requirement Analysis − When the SRD is ready and shared with the stakeholders, the testing team starts high level analysis concerning the AUT (Application under Test).
        * Test Planning − Test Team plans the strategy and approach.
        * Test Case Designing − Develop the test cases based on scope and criteria’s.
        * Test Environment Setup − When integrated environment is ready to validate the product.
        * Test Execution − Real-time validation of product and finding bugs.
        * Test Closure − Once testing is completed, matrix, reports, results are documented.
