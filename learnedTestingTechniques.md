# Web Developer Study
## 12 months web developer study. I decided to dedicate at least 12 months to learn web development.

* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
### Testing
* Testing Techniques
    * What is Software Testing Technique?
        Software Testing Techniques help you design better test cases. Since exhaustive testing is not possible; Manual Testing Techniques help reduce the number of test cases to be executed while increasing test coverage. They help identify test conditions that are otherwise difficult to recognize.
    * Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
        * Boundary value analysis is based on testing at the boundaries between partitions. It includes maximum, minimum, inside or outside boundaries, typical values and error values.

    * Equivalence Class Partitioning
        * Equivalent Class Partitioning allows you to divide set of test condition into a partition which should be considered the same. This software testing method divides the input domain of a program into classes of data from which test cases should be designed.

    * Decision Table Based Testing.
        * A decision table is also known as to Cause-Effect table. This software testing technique is used for functions which respond to a combination of inputs or events. For example, a submit button should be enabled if the user has entered all required fields.
    
    * State Transition
       * In State Transition technique changes in input conditions change the state of the Application Under Test (AUT). This testing technique allows the tester to test the behavior of an AUT. The tester can perform this action by entering various input conditions in a sequence. In State transition technique, the testing team provides positive as well as negative input test values for evaluating the system behavior.

    * Error Guessing
        * Error Guessing is a software testing technique based on guessing the error which can prevail in the code. The technique is heavily based on the experience where the test analysts use their experience to guess the problematic part of the testing application. Hence, the test analysts must be skilled and experienced for better error guessing.
    
    * Exploratory Testing
        * Exploratory testing is all about exploring the application. Experienced testers can justify this testing technique with their experience and domain knowledge. Not much planning is required as the test cases are prepared while testing is being done. It requires minimum planning & maximum test execution.

    * Use Case Testing
        * Use Case represents the different ways in which the system can be used by the users. The use case divides the system behavior into scenarios, such that each scenario performs some useful action from the userâ€™s point of view.

    * Risk-Based Testing
        * A risk is an unfavorable event or circumstance that can occur while a product is being developed. Risk-based testing helps to detect the most important and critical bugs at an early stage.

    * User Story Testing (Agile)
        * A user story is a short and simple description of requirements from the customers or end-user. User stories are written by the Product owner as they are the ones who get the information from the customer for the product to be built

    * Branch Coverage
        * Branch coverage testing is also called EDGE testing. In this technique, the test cases are designed to cover all the branches and each branch condition returns true & false values in return.

    * Path Coverage
        * The Path coverage-based testing designs the test cases such that all the linearly independent paths in a program are executed at least once. A linearly independent path can be defined through the control flow graph. A control flow graph defines how the instruction of a program gets executed.
