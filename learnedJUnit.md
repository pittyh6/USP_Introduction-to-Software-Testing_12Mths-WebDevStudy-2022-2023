## 12 months web developer study. I decided to dedicate at least 12 months to learn web development.

* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
### Testing
* JUnit 4
    * JUnit is a simple framework to write repeatable tests. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.
* JUnit 5
    * JUnit 5 is the next generation of JUnit. The goal is to create an up-to-date foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM. This includes focusing on Java 8 and above, as well as enabling many different styles of testing.
* JUnit (4 / 5)
    * annotation
        * @Before / @BeforeEach
        * @After / @AfterEach
        * @BeforeClass / @BeforeAll
        * @AfterClass / @AfterAll
        * @Test / @Test
        * The method annotated with @BeforeClass is executed once at the start of the class.
        * The method annotated with @Before executes before Testcase 1 begins.
        * The method Testcase1 annotated with @Test is the testcase in the class.
        * The method annotated with @After runs after Testcase 1 completes execution.
        * The method annotated with @Before executes before Testcase 2 begins.
        * The method Testcase2 annotated with @Test is the testcase in the class.
        * The method annotated with @After runs after Testcase 2 completes execution.
        * The method annotated with @AfterClass is executed once at the end of the class after both testcase 1 and 2 are executed.

        * The method annotated with @BeforeAll is executed once at the start of the class.
        * The method annotated with @BeforeEach executes before Testcase 1 begins.
        * The method Testcase1 annotated with @Test is the testcase in the class.
        * The method annotated with @AfterEach runs after Testcase 1 completes execution.
        * The method annotated with @BeforeEach executes before Testcase 2 begins.
        * The method Testcase2 annotated with @Test is the testcase in the class.
        * The method annotated with @AfterEach runs after Testcase 2 completes execution.
        * The method annotated with @AfterAll is executed once at the end of the class after both testcase 1 and 2 are executed.
