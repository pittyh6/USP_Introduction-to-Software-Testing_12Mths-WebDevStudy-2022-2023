# Web Developer Study
## 12 months web developer study. I decided to dedicate at least 12 months to learn web development.

* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
### Testing
* Software Test
    * TMMI 
        * TMMi or Test Maturity Model Integration improves the software testing practices for the organizations and also alleviates the IT standards for it.
        * estabelecer requisitos para os testes
        * 5 levels
            * objetivos expecificos
            * praticas especificas
            * subpraticas
            * objetivos genericos
            * particas genericas
        * TMMI x CMMI
            * CMMi mainly focuses on software development practices, giving no or very less attention on the testing processes     which involves 30% to 40% of complete project efforts. 
            * Hence TMMi was introduced by TMMi foundation to focus on testing processes.
                TMMi framework focuses completely on the processes and practices that are applied to software testing with intent to raise the quality and efficiency of the testing process.

    * Terminologia
        * error/mistake -> defect/fault/bug -> failure
        * Defect => The defect is an error found AFTER the application goes into production.
            * Wrong: When requirements are implemented not in the right way. 
            * Missing: A requirement of the customer that was not fulfilled. 
            * Extra: A requirement incorporated into the product that was not given by the end customer. 
            * ERROR: An error is a mistake, misconception, or misunderstanding on the part of a software developer.
        * BUG: A bug is the result of a coding error. An Error found in the development environment before the product is shipped to the customer. 
        * falha / FAILURE: A failure is the inability of a software system or component to perform its required functions within specified performance requirements. When a defect reaches the end customer it is called a Failure. During development, Failures are usually observed by testers.
        * defeito / FAULT: An incorrect step, process or data definition in a computer program that causes the program to perform in an unintended or unanticipated manner. A fault is introduced into the software as the result of an error. It is an anomaly in the software that may cause it to behave incorrectly, and not according to its specification. It is the result of the error.
        
        ### Bug
        * It is an informal name specified to the defect.
        ### Defect
        * The Defect is the difference between the actual outcomes and expected outputs.
        ### Error
        * An Error is a mistake made in the code; that's why we cannot execute or compile code.
        ### Fault
        * The Fault is a state that causes the software to fail to accomplish its essential function.
        ### Failure
        * If the software has lots of defects, it leads to failure or causes failure.
