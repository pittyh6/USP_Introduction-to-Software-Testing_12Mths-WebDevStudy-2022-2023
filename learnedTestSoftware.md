* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
### Testing
* Software Test
    * TMMI 
        * TMMi or Test Maturity Model Integration improves the software testing practices for the organizations and also alleviates the IT standards for it.
        * estabelecer requisitos para os testes
        * 5 levels
            * objetivos expecificos
            * praticas especificas
            * subpraticas
            * objetivos genericos
            * particas genericas
        * TMMI x CMMI
            * CMMi mainly focuses on software development practices, giving no or very less attention on the testing processes     which involves 30% to 40% of complete project efforts. 
            * Hence TMMi was introduced by TMMi foundation to focus on testing processes.
                TMMi framework focuses completely on the processes and practices that are applied to software testing with intent to raise the quality and efficiency of the testing process.
